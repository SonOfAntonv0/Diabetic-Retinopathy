<h2><u>What is Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) ?</u></h2>
Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).At first, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. Eventually, it can cause blindness.The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.

<h2> <u>Different Stages of DR</u></h2><br>
<ul>
  <li>Mild</li><br>
  <li>Moderate</li><br>
  <li>Severe</li><br>
  <li>Proliferative</li><br> 
</ul>
<h2><u> Objective</u> </h2>
The problem of identificataion of DR is converted to an image recognition problem. We leverage Convolutional Neural Networks to learn patterns to discern retinal images denoting different stages of DR.
